## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users:
1. **First Time Setup:**
   - Open `index.html` (home page) or go directly to `login.html`
   - Enter your name and select your grade
   - Click "Create New User"

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Select a subject
   - Click an unlocked level (🔢 symbol)
   - Complete the quiz with 70% or higher to unlock the next level

3. **Logging In Again:**
   - Open login page
   - Click your name in "Previous Users" section
   - Click "Continue"

4. **Subject Pages:**
   - Visit individual subject pages (e.g., `math/index.html`) for direct level access
   - Kindergarten students can start from `K/index.html`

### For Developers:

#### Add More Questions:
Edit `js/questionBank.js`:
```javascript
const questionBank = {
    K: {
        math: {
            1: [
                { question: "Your question", answers: [
                    { text: "Option 1", correct: false },
                    { text: "Correct Answer", correct: true }
                ]}
            ]
        }
    }
    // ... more grades and subjects
};
```

#### Modify Difficulty/Settings:
- **Passing Score:** Change in `userManager.js` - `const passingPercentage = 70;`
- **Questions per Level:** Add more to `questionBank.js`
- **Number of Levels:** Modify array length in `initializeUserProgress()`

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### User Authentication:
```javascript
// Session-based - user ID stored in sessionStorage
// Gets cleared on browser close or logout
sessionStorage.setItem('pssaCurrentUser', userId);
```

### Level Protection:
```javascript
// Before showing quiz, verify:
1. User is logged in
2. Level is unlocked
3. Previous level was completed with 70%+
```

### Progress Storage:
```javascript
// Data structure prevents tampering:
{
    userId: "user_1712345678",
    grades: {
        "3": {
            "math": {
                levels: [
                    { levelNum: 1, completed: true, score: 85, locked: false },
                    { levelNum: 2, completed: false, score: 0, locked: false }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
